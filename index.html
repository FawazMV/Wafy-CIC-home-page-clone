            <p class="text">'Knowledge exists potentially in the human soul like the seed in the soil; by learning the potential becomes actual. ' Abu Hamid al-Ghazali <br>
                The purpose of education is to develop the whole person â€“ heart, soul and intelligence, for serving the common good by seeking knowledge and acquiring <br> virtues. And this purpose can be achieved only when the process of learning is infused with a spiritual dynamic and moral compass. The Coordination of <br>
                 Islamic Colleges (CIC) embodies this holistic vision of knowledge. <br>
                As a multi-layered educational governing body, CIC strives to restore the harmony among the multiple paradigms of knowledge and wisdom: the sacred and <br>
                 the secular; the revelatory and the empirical; the spiritual and the temporal etc. <br>
                The greatest enemy of real knowledge is not ignorance but the illusion of knowing. Dogmas of truth, be it scientific or religious, can only be mutually exclusive <br>
                 and antipathetic. But serving as cross-fertilizing knowledge-systems they can become complementary and harmonized. <br>
                The CIC seeks to achieve this by blending the principles of faith, vision, and creativity. The courses designed and implemented by CIC aim to mould morally <br>
                 committed professionals, intellectuals and spiritual leaders who are grounded in the Islamic scholarly tradition and conversant with the scientific, cultural, <br>
                  political, and intellectual currents that are shaping the modern society. <br></p>
